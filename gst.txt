General Notes from the FAQ
Effective Date: Most changes are effective from 22nd September, 2025 (except for specified tobacco products).

"Special Rate": The 40% GST rate applies to a few select goods and services, predominantly "sin goods" (like tobacco, casinos) and luxury goods (like large cars). This rate absorbs the old Compensation Cess.

Inverted Duty Structure: For sectors where the reduced GST rate deepens an inverted duty structure (input tax > output tax), a refund mechanism for accumulated Input Tax Credit (ITC) is available.

ITC on Old Stock: ITC accrued at higher rates before the change can still be used to pay output tax liability after the change.

E-way Bills: No need to cancel and regenerate e-way bills for goods in transit when the new rates come into effect.




Based on standard GST slabs and context, we can infer the most likely rates:

Natural Honey vs. Artificial Honey: The FAQ states the differential treatment is "to promote natural honey" but does not specify the new rates for either. It is highly likely that natural honey is now exempt (0%) or at 5%, while artificial honey remains at a higher rate (likely 18%).

Carbonated Beverages with Fruit Juice: The FAQ states the rate was increased to compensate for the removal of the Compensation Cess but does not state the new rate. Given it's called a "sin good," the new rate is almost certainly the "special rate" of 40%.

Coal: The FAQ states the old rate (5% + ₹400/ton Cess) has been merged into a new GST rate with "no additional burden." It does not state the new ad valorem rate. A common inference is a rate of 12% or 18%, but this is a significant omission.

Mouthwash: The FAQ explains why it was not reduced but does not confirm what rate it remains at. It stays at the standard rate of 18%.

2. Missing Key Goods and Services
The FAQ answers specific questions but does not provide a comprehensive list of all goods and services. Therefore, many common items are missing because they weren't asked about. For example:

Basic Food Items: No mention of staples like wheat, rice, fresh vegetables, fruits, which are typically exempt.

Common Electronics: No mention of mobile phones, laptops, or other household appliances besides ACs, TVs, and dishwashers.

Apparel and Footwear: A major sector with complex rate structures is not covered in detail beyond some raw material discussions.

Financial Services: Besides insurance, services like banking, stock brokerage, etc., are not mentioned.

Telecom Services: Not mentioned.

Construction and Real Estate Services: Not mentioned.

3. Clarifications and Context from the FAQ
Some points in the initial summary, while correct, benefit from the context given in the FAQ answers:

Why not 0%? For many goods (like medicines, agricultural machinery, tractors), the FAQ repeatedly explains that a nil rate (0%) would break the Input Tax Credit (ITC) chain. This would force manufacturers to absorb input costs or pass them on, ultimately making the product more expensive for the consumer/farmer. Therefore, a 5% rate is a compromise that provides relief while preserving the ITC chain.

The "Special Rate" of 40%: This isn't a new slab but a consolidation. It applies to goods that previously had 28% GST + a high Compensation Cess (like large cars, tobacco). The cess has been eliminated, and the total tax burden is merged into a single 40% GST rate.

The Principle of "Rate Rationalization": The key driver behind these changes is to minimize classification disputes. The Council aimed to put similar goods in the same tax bracket (e.g., all "Indian breads," all TVs, all batteries).
